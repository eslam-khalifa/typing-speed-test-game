    "Some people combine touch typing and hunt and peck by using a buffering method. In the buffer method, the typist looks at the source copy, mentally stores one or several sentences, then looks at the keyboard and types out the buffer of sentences. This eliminates frequent up and down motions with the head and is used in typing competitions in which the typist is not well versed in touch typing. Not normally used in day-to-day contact with keyboards, this buffer method is used only when time is of the essence. (Wikipedia)",
    "In 1995, a small manufacturing company was struggling to stay afloat. Employee morale was low, production costs were high, and competition was fierce. Then, a new CEO, John, took the helm. He implemented a series of bold changes, including investing in new technology, implementing lean manufacturing principles, and fostering a culture of innovation. The transformation was slow but steady. Within 5 years, the company had reduced production costs by 15% and increased profits by 10%. Over the next 15 years, the company continued to grow and evolve, expanding into new markets and launching innovative products. By 2015, the company had become a global leader in its industry, with a workforce of over 5,000 employees and annual revenue of $1 billion. John's leadership and vision had transformed the company from a struggling enterprise into a thriving success story.",
    "Typing is not just a valuable skill for the workplace; it's also a practical life skill that can benefit individuals in various aspects of their lives. From writing emails and essays to creating resumes and social media posts, typing is a fundamental form of communication in the digital age. Learning to type at a young age can help children develop fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and cognitive abilities. It can also boost their confidence and self-esteem as they master a new skill. As they progress through school and into adulthood, typing skills become essential for academic success and career advancement. Beyond the practical benefits, typing can also be a creative outlet. Many people enjoy writing stories, poems, or blog posts in their free time. Typing allows them to express their thoughts and ideas easily and efficiently. Whether you're a student, a professional, or a lifelong learner, developing strong typing skills is a worthwhile investment. It can open doors to new opportunities, enhance your communication abilities, and enrich your personal and professional life.",
    "Being human makes us susceptible to the onset of feelings. The role of these emotions varies. Some of them are useful while others may be harmful. The use of social media for self-expression has reached a point that it makes us feel we can say anything. This begins when we see people expressing anything and everything that come to mind. When we see everyone else voicing their likes and dislikes, their irritations and desires we tend to imitate what they do. And because many engage in this, we think that it is normal and healthy. However, when we get used to unbridled self-expression, we come to believe that all feelings are valid. We become convinced that in real life, we should also act on our emotions and our impulses. Using social media this way erodes our ability to regulate our actions and reactions. To illustrate, when something small irritates us we think that it's okay to feel this way. But isn't it better to foster one's patience and resilience instead of immediately complaining? Or when we develop an attraction to someone despite that person being in a relationship, and because social media has conditioned us that all feelings can be expressed, we tend to think that acting on this attraction is okay. Not all feelings deserve expression. We find ourselves creating our own problems when we let our present emotions control our actions.",

    "Ten years after graduating from business school, a group of alumni gathered for their reunion. As they reminisced about their college days and shared stories of their careers, a common theme emerged: the power of networking. Many of them had landed their first jobs through connections made in school. Others had collaborated on successful business ventures with former classmates. One alumnus, Emily, had even met her husband through a mutual friend from the program. The reunion served as a reminder of the importance of building and maintaining relationships throughout one's career. It highlighted the value of staying connected with former colleagues, mentors, and classmates, who could offer support, advice, and opportunities. The alumni resolved to stay in touch more regularly, recognizing that their network was a valuable asset that could help them navigate the ever-changing business landscape. They also pledged to give back to their alma mater by mentoring current students and participating in alumni events. The 10-year reunion not only rekindled old friendships but also reinforced the importance of networking in achieving career success and personal fulfillment.",
    "Today, historians relate that, as a general rule, buying and selling securities was very much unorganized before the year 1792. Every person who owned a security faced the problem of finding interested buyers who might consider the purchase of a debt-free investment. This meant most people were somewhat slow in investing in stocks and bonds because these securities could not readily be converted into money. We have been told that an interesting number of traders and merchants agreed to try to do something to help correct the situation. At this first crucial meeting, they decided that it was a good idea to visit regularly on a daily basis to buy and sell securities. The group of leaders, whose meeting place was under an old, tall cottonwood tree, found the needed time to plot the financial future of our nation. We know from reading the old records that the original team who met together long ago in May became the very first members of the New York Stock Exchange. The New York Stock Exchange is still operating. Other stock exchanges conduct business in many countries around the world. Thousands and thousands of stocks and bonds are bought and sold each day.",
    "Sarah, a young entrepreneur, was browsing a thrift store when a worn-out leather-bound notebook caught her eye. It was priced at a mere $5. Intrigued, she bought it and discovered pages filled with business ideas from the 1920s. Inspired, she adapted one idea to the modern market, launching a successful online vintage clothing store. That $5 notebook became the catalyst for a multi-million dollar business, proving that sometimes, the most valuable investments come in unexpected packages.",
    "A virtual assistant (typically abbreviated to VA) is generally self-employed and provides professional administrative, technical, or creative assistance to clients remotely from a home office.",
    "The recent emergence of several competitive typing websites has allowed several fast typists on computer keyboards to emerge along with new records, though these are unverifiable for the most part. Two of the most notable online records that are considered genuine are 241.82 wpm on an English text on typingzone.com by Brazilian Guilherme Sandrini (equivalent to 290.184 wpm using the traditional definition for words per minute since this site defines a word as six characters rather than five) and 256 wpm (a record caught on video) on TypeRacer by American Sean Wrona, the inaugural Ultimate Typing Championship winner, which was considered the highest ever legitimate score ever set on the site, until Wrona claimed it has been surpassed. Both of these records are essentially sprint speeds on short text selections lasting much less than one minute and were achieved on the QWERTY keyboard. Wrona also maintained 174 wpm on a 50-minute test taken on hi-games.net, another online typing website to unofficially displace Blackburn as the fastest endurance typist, although disputes might still arise over differences in the difficulty of the texts as well as Wrona's use of a modern computer keyboard as opposed to the typewriter used by Blackburn.",
    "Income before securities transactions was up 10.8 percent from $13.49 million in 1982 to $14.95 million in 1983. Earnings per share (adjusted for a 10.5 percent stock dividend distributed on August 26) advanced 10 percent to $2.39 in 1983 from $2.17 in 1982. Earnings may rise for 7 years. Hopefully, earnings per share will grow another 10 percent. Kosy, Klemin, and Bille began selling on May 23, 1964. Their second store was founded in Renton on August 3, 1965. From 1964 to 1984, they opened more than 50 stores through-out the country. As they expanded, 12 regional offices had to be organized. Each of these 12 regional offices had to be organized. Each of these 12 regions employs from 108 to 578 people. National headquarters employs 1,077 people. Carole owns 118 stores located in 75 cities ranging as far west as Seattle and as far east as Boston. She owns 46 stores south of the Mason-Dixon line and 24 stores north of Denver. Carole buys goods from 89 companies located in 123 countries and all 50 states. Carole started in business on March 3, 1975. She had less than $6,000 in capital assets.",
    "Asking for help is not a sign of weakness but rather a smart strategy for academic success. Most educational institutions offer a variety of resources and support systems to help students succeed. This can include tutoring services, academic advising, counseling, and writing centers. Professors and teaching assistants are also valuable resources who can provide guidance and clarification on course material. Don't hesitate to reach out if you're struggling with a particular concept or assignment. Seeking help early on can prevent small problems from snowballing into larger issues.",
    "Many touch typists also use keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys when typing on a computer. This allows them to edit their document without having to take their hands off the keyboard to use a mouse. An example of a keyboard shortcut is pressing the Ctrl key plus the S key to save a document as they type, or the Ctrl key plus the Z key to undo a mistake. Many experienced typists can feel or sense when they have made an error and can hit the Backspace key and make the correction with no increase in time between keystrokes.",
    "Two members of the 1984 class of Jefferson High School are chairing a group of 18 to look for a resort for the 20-year class reunion. A lovely place 78 miles from the city turns out to be the best. It has 254 rooms and a banquet hall to seat 378. It has been open 365 days per year since opening on May 30, 1926. They will need 450 to reserve the resort. Debbie Holmes was put in charge of buying 2,847 office machines for the entire firm. Debbie visited more than 109 companies in 35 states in 6 months. She will report to the board today in Room 2784 at 5 p.m. The board will consider her report about those 109 firms and recommend the top 2 or 3 brands to purchase. Debbie must decide before August 16. Lynn Greene said work started on the project March 27, 2003. The 246 blueprints were mailed to the office 18 days ago. The prints had to be 100 percent accurate before they were acceptable. The project should be finished by May 31, 2025. At that time there will be 47 new condominiums, each having at least 16 rooms. The building will be 25 stories.",
    "Proofreader applicants are tested primarily on their spelling, speed, and skill in finding errors in the sample text. Toward that end, they may be given a list of ten or twenty classically difficult words and a proofreading test, both tightly timed. The proofreading test will often have a maximum number of errors per quantity of text and a minimum amount of time to find them. The goal of this approach is to identify those with the best skill set.",
    "In one study of average computer users, the average rate for transcription was 33 words per minute, and 19 words per minute for composition. In the same study, when the group was divided into \"fast\", \"moderate\" and \"slow\" groups, the average speeds were 40 wpm, 35 wpm, and 23 wpm respectively. An average professional typist reaches 50 to 80 wpm, while some positions can require 80 to 95 wpm (usually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other typing jobs), and some advanced typists work at speeds above 120 wpm. Two-finger typists, sometimes also referred to as \"hunt and peck\" typists, commonly reach sustained speeds of about 37 wpm for memorized text and 27 wpm when copying text, but in bursts may be able to reach speeds of 60 to 70 wpm. From the 1920s through the 1970s, typing speed (along with shorthand speed) was an important secretarial qualification and typing contests were popular and often publicized by typewriter companies as promotional tools.",
    "Business casual is an ambiguously defined dress code that has been adopted by many professional and white-collar workplaces in Western countries. It entails neat yet casual attire and is generally more casual than informal attire but more formal than casual or smart casual attire. Casual Fridays preceded widespread acceptance of business casual attire in many offices.",
    "Effective communication is the lifeblood of teamwork, the channel through which ideas flow, feedback is given, and conflicts are resolved. Open, honest, and respectful communication fosters understanding, builds trust, and promotes collaboration. It allows team members to share their perspectives, clarify expectations, and coordinate their efforts towards a common goal. When communication breaks down, misunderstandings arise, conflicts escalate, and progress stalls. By fostering a culture of open communication, teams can create a positive and productive work environment where everyone feels heard and valued.",
    "Brackets ([ ]) serve a similar purpose to parentheses, offering additional information or clarification within a sentence. They are often used to insert editorial comments, translations, or explanations of technical terms. Think of them as side notes whispered in the reader's ear."
